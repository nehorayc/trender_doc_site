By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system extracts key information such as subjects, objects, locations, and sentiments. The system is organized around the 4W Intelligence Framework : When, Where, Who, and What, providing users with advanced filtering and analysis capabilities for news trends. Key Features of Trender Automated News Collection : Trender pulls articles from various sources, constantly updating to provide the latest information. NLP-Powered Analysis : Through the use of NLP, Trender can identify and categorize entities like people (subjects), locations, and objects, as well as actions taken. Sentiment Detection : Analyze the sentiment between actors to understand the relationships or attitudes expressed in news articles. Advanced Filtering : The system allows users to filter the news articles by date, location, actors, types of events, and more. The 4W Intelligence Framework Trender is built around the 4W framework, which allows users to filter and analyze news articles by When the events occurred, Where they happened, Who was involved, and What the events were about. Quick Links: When: Date Filters and Granularity Where: Location-based Filtering Who: Actors and Sentiment Analysis What: Event Categorization and Importance Detailed Breakdown of the 4Ws 1. When: Time-Based Filtering The When filter allows users to select a date range for the articles they want to explore. Users can also adjust the level of granularity , choosing between daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly displays. This helps in identifying trends and changes over time. For more information, visit the When Page . 2. Where: Location-based Filtering The Where filter helps users focus on the geographical aspect of events. It includes: Event location : Where the event happened. Subject location : The origin of the subject performing the action. Object location : The origin of the object upon whom the action was performed. Users can filter by region, sub-region, and country. For more information, visit the Where Page . 3. Who: Subjects, Objects, and Sentiment The Who filter allows users to focus on the individuals or entities involved in the news: Subject : The one who performed the action. Object : The one upon whom the action was performed. Sentiment : The sentiment expressed by the subject towards the object, and vice versa. The system supports ICEWS (Integrated Crisis Early Warning System) actor types, making it easy to categorize the involved parties. For more information, visit the Who Page . 4. What: Categorizing Events and Actions The What filter focuses on the content and nature of the events in the articles: Primary Category : The main category the article fits into (e.g., politics, health, armed conflicts). CAMEO Code : The action code as per the CAMEO framework. Importance : A measure of how frequently the news event was reported. Users can also search for specific keywords in the article content. For more information, visit the What Page . Use Cases for Trender Crisis Monitoring : Analysts can track the progression of crises over time, filtering by location, actors, and sentiment. Political Analysis : Identify trends in political news by filtering articles for specific events or actors, and examine sentiment between political figures. Regional Trends : Focus on events happening in specific regions, using the location-based filters to gather insights on regional conflicts or cooperation.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/#trender-project-overview","text":"Trender is an AI-driven system designed to collect and analyze news articles from multiple sources.

This slicer provides options to narrow down results by the primary category of the article, CAMEO code, importance, and specific content within the article. Primary Category 1. Overview The Primary Category allows users to filter articles by the main topic or theme they are related to. Each article is automatically assigned a category based on its content using AI-driven classification. More can be found in the Categories page How to use: Select the desired category from the slicer to filter and view articles that match the chosen category. Example: To see all articles related to Health events, choose \"Health\" from the Primary Category dropdown, and the results will display only health-related news. CAMEO Code 2. What is CAMEO? The CAMEO (Conflict and Mediation Event Observations) code provides a more detailed classification of the actions or events described in the news articles. CAMEO codes are often used for tracking international events and conflicts. Example CAMEO codes include: 010 : Make Public Statement 181 : Assault 194 : Accuse 030 : Consult How to use: Use the CAMEO Code slicer to filter articles based on the specific action or event type. You can input specific CAMEO codes or search for them by name. Example: To find articles where a public statement was made, you can filter by CAMEO code 010 . This will return articles categorized as such by the system. Importance 3. Measuring Article Importance The Importance slicer allows users to filter articles based on how frequently they are discussed or repeated across multiple sources or even multiple times on a single source. This feature helps in identifying high-impact or widely covered stories. Importance Levels: High : Articles that have been repeated or referenced in multiple news outlets. Medium : Moderately covered stories. Low : Less prominent articles that appear fewer times. How to use: Adjust the Importance slider to show articles based on how much they have been repeated in the dataset. Example: To focus on articles with widespread coverage, set the importance filter to \"High\". This will display only the most discussed news stories. Content 4. Search by Specific Content The Content slicer allows you to search for specific text or keywords within the article\u2019s body. This is helpful when you are looking for articles that mention exact phrases, events, or people. How to use: Enter the desired text or keyword into the Content slicer to search for matching articles. The system will return articles that contain the exact text or keywords in their body. Example: If you want to find all articles that mention the term \"climate change\", simply enter it in the Content field. The results will show only the articles where this term appears.

This powerful feature helps you analyze events and trends by region, country, or specific locations related to the subject or object of the action. Understanding where events occur is crucial in identifying regional patterns, conflicts, and other location-based phenomena. Location Filters 1. Location The Location filter shows where the event reported in the news article occurred. You can filter by continent, sub-region, or specific country. How to use: Select a region from the dropdown menu (e.g., Africa, North America). Drill down into sub-regions or countries to refine your search (e.g., Western Europe, South America). Example: To focus on news articles about political events in the Westren Asia, you can select Westren Asia from the sub-region options, and only news related to this region will be displayed. 2. Subject Location The Subject Location filter narrows down articles based on where the subject (the one performing the action) is located. This can be useful for analyzing patterns of action initiated from certain regions or countries. How to use: Choose a continent or country that the subject originates from. This filter helps track actions based on the subject's origin rather than where the event occurred. Example: If you want to see actions performed by subjects from Russia , select Russia under the Subject Location filter. 3. Object Location The Object Location filter works similarly to the Subject Location but focuses on the location of the object (the one the action is performed on). This is essential for understanding the target regions of actions or events. How to use: Select a continent, region, or country for the object\u2019s location. The system will display articles where the object is located in the chosen area. Example: If you're interested in how entities in Asia are affected by global events, use the Object Location filter to narrow down results to that region. Combining Location Filters The Where filters can be used individually or in combination with each other for more detailed analysis. You can filter articles by both the event location and the origin of the subject or object, allowing for more precise insights. Example: To investigate news about actions initiated from Europe that target entities in North America , you can: - Set the Subject Location to Europe . - Set the Object Location to North America . - The system will then show articles matching this cross-location interaction. Use Cases 1. Regional Crisis Monitoring By filtering news articles based on Event Location , you can monitor crisis events happening in a specific region, such as Sub-Saharan Africa , to stay updated on regional conflicts or health emergencies. 2. Cross-Border Relations By combining the Subject Location and Object Location filters, you can analyze cross-border interactions. For example, you can examine news about diplomatic efforts initiated by countries in Europe toward entities in South America . 3. Analyzing Global Influence Use the Subject Location filter to track actions initiated from powerful nations, like the United States or China , and study how these actions impact different regions worldwide. Advanced Features Multi-Location Selection : Trender allows you to select multiple regions or countries for both subject and object locations, enabling you to view broader trends across continents or countries. Heatmap Display : For a visual representation of location-based data, Trender can display a heatmap showing where the highest concentration of news articles originates, helping identify hotspots of activity. Examples 1. Political Events in Latin America Set the Event Location filter to South America to focus on political developments across Latin American countries. 2. Actions by European Countries Toward Africa Use Subject Location = Europe and Object Location = Africa to track interactions, such as diplomatic or economic actions between these two regions.

This section is crucial for focusing on the individuals or groups that drive the events described in the articles. In Trender, this is divided into Subjects and Objects . Subject Filters The Subject refers to the individual or group that performed the action described in the news article. You can filter articles by various attributes of the subject. 1. Subject Name The Subject Name filter lets you search for articles that mention a specific subject. This could be a person, organization, or any entity acting within the event. How to use: Enter the name of the subject you want to track. For example, typing \"Joe Biden\" will return articles where Joe Biden is the primary subject. 2. Subject Type (ICEWS Classification) The Subject Type filter allows users to categorize subjects based on predefined types from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) taxonomy. These types can include categories such as \"Government,\" \"Military,\" \"Non-State Actor,\" etc. How to use: Select a subject type from the dropdown menu. Example: Selecting \"Government\" will display articles where the subject is a government entity. Common Subject Types: Government : State actors like presidents, prime ministers, etc. Military : Armed forces personnel. Non-State Actor : Terrorist organizations, NGOs, etc. Object Filters The Object is the entity on which the action is performed. Like the subject, objects can be filtered to narrow down news coverage by specific targets or recipients of the action. 3. Object Name The Object Name filter works similarly to the subject name filter, but it focuses on the target of the action in the article. How to use: Enter the name of the object in the search bar. Example: Searching for \"Ukraine\" will display articles where Ukraine is the object or target of actions described in the articles. 4. Object Type (ICEWS Classification) Similar to subject type, Object Type filters use ICEWS classifications to sort objects into predefined categories. How to use: Select an object type from the dropdown menu to focus on specific kinds of entities. Example: Choosing \"Non-State Actor\" will return articles where the object is a non-state actor, such as a rebel group or activist organization. Sentiment Filters In addition to filtering by who the subject and object are, Trender also allows users to filter based on the sentiment between the actors. 5. Actor 1 Sentiment (Subject\u2019s Sentiment toward Object) This filter lets you explore the sentiment of the Subject toward the Object in the article. Sentiment analysis is performed using NLP techniques and is expressed as positive, neutral, or negative. How to use: Choose whether you want to see articles where the sentiment of the subject (Actor 1) toward the object (Actor 2) is positive , (-1) neutral (0), or negative (+1). Example: If you select negative sentiment, you\u2019ll see articles where the subject (e.g., a government) has a negative stance toward the object (e.g., a corporation). 6. Actor 2 Sentiment (Object\u2019s Sentiment toward Subject) This filter works similarly to Actor 1 Sentiment but focuses on the Object\u2019s sentiment toward the Subject . How to use: Choose whether to display articles where the sentiment of the object (Actor 2) toward the subject (Actor 1) is positive , (-1) neutral (0), or negative (+1). Example: If the object (e.g., a country) has a positive sentiment toward the subject (e.g., a politician), those articles will be displayed. Use Cases Identifying Influential Actors in Conflicts By using the Subject Name and Subject Type filters, you can easily track key actors in major global conflicts, such as government officials or military leaders. Analyzing Relationships Between Countries or Entities The Sentiment Filters provide insights into how the subject and object interact. For example, if you want to know how the media portrays the relationship between two countries, you can filter based on sentiment analysis. Tracking Specific Entities Over Time Using the Object Name filter in combination with the When filter allows users to track the media\u2019s focus on a particular country or entity over time. Summary of Filters Subject Name : Filter by who performed the action. Subject Type : Categorize subjects using ICEWS classifications. Object Name : Filter by the target of the action. Object Type : Categorize objects using ICEWS classifications. Actor 1 Sentiment : Sentiment of subject toward object. Actor 2 Sentiment : Sentiment of object toward subject.

How to use: Enter the name of the subject you want to track. For example, typing \"Joe Biden\" will return articles where Joe Biden is the primary subject. 2. Subject Type (ICEWS Classification) The Subject Type filter allows users to categorize subjects based on predefined types from the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) taxonomy. The ICEWS sectors ontology organizes entities into a hierarchical structure, ranging from broad sectors to specific offices or ministries, allowing for detailed categorization of subjects. Examples include \"Government,\" \"Military,\" and \"Non-State Actor.\" How to use: Select a subject type from the dropdown menu. Example: Selecting \"Government\" will display articles where the subject is a government entity. Common Subject Types (ICEWS Sectors Overview): Government : State actors such as presidents, prime ministers, or executive offices. Military : Armed forces personnel and entities. Non-State Actor : Groups or individuals not affiliated with a state, such as NGOs, rebel groups, or terrorist organizations. This taxonomy supports consistent analysis by categorizing subjects with precision. Object Filters The Object is the entity on which the action is performed. Like the subject, objects can be filtered to narrow down news coverage by specific targets or recipients of the action. 3. Object Name The Object Name filter works similarly to the subject name filter but focuses on the target of the action in the article. How to use: Enter the name of the object in the search bar. Example: Searching for \"Ukraine\" will display articles where Ukraine is the object or target of actions described in the articles. 4. Object Type (ICEWS Classification) Similar to subject type, Object Type filters use ICEWS classifications to sort objects into predefined categories. This allows for precise filtering by categorizing targets based on the ICEWS sectors ontology. How to use: Select an object type from the dropdown menu to focus on specific kinds of entities. Example: Choosing \"Non-State Actor\" will return articles where the object is a non-state actor, such as a rebel group or activist organization. Sentiment Filters In addition to filtering by who the subject and object are, Trender also allows users to filter based on the sentiment between the actors. 5. Actor 1 Sentiment (Subject\u2019s Sentiment toward Object) This filter lets you explore the sentiment of the Subject toward the Object in the article. Sentiment analysis is performed using NLP techniques and is expressed as positive, neutral, or negative. How to use: Choose whether you want to see articles where the sentiment of the subject (Actor 1) toward the object (Actor 2) is positive (-1), neutral (0), or negative (+1). Example: If you select negative sentiment, you\u2019ll see articles where the subject (e.g., a government) has a negative stance toward the object (e.g., a corporation). 6. Actor 2 Sentiment (Object\u2019s Sentiment toward Subject) This filter works similarly to Actor 1 Sentiment but focuses on the Object\u2019s sentiment toward the Subject . How to use: Choose whether to display articles where the sentiment of the object (Actor 2) toward the subject (Actor 1) is positive (-1), neutral (0), or negative (+1). Example: If the object (e.g., a country) has a positive sentiment toward the subject (e.g., a politician), those articles will be displayed. Use Cases Identifying Influential Actors in Conflicts By using the Subject Name and Subject Type filters, you can easily track key actors in major global conflicts, such as government officials or military leaders. Analyzing Relationships Between Countries or Entities The Sentiment Filters provide insights into how the subject and object interact. For example, if you want to know how the media portrays the relationship between two countries, you can filter based on sentiment analysis. Tracking Specific Entities Over Time Using the Object Name filter in combination with the When filter allows users to track the media\u2019s focus on a particular country or entity over time. Summary of Filters Subject Name : Filter by who performed the action. Subject Type : Categorize subjects using ICEWS classifications. Object Name : Filter by the target of the action. Object Type : Categorize objects using ICEWS classifications. Actor 1 Sentiment : Sentiment of subject toward object. Actor 2 Sentiment : Sentiment of object toward subject. ICEWS Ontology Overview The Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) sectors ontology is a hierarchical classification system designed to organize and categorize entities involved in global events, particularly for crisis analysis and early warning purposes. This structure allows analysts to systematically identify roles and functions across various sectors, from broad national levels to specific government offices, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of geopolitical analysis. Structure of the ICEWS Sectors Tree The ICEWS sectors ontology is organized as a tree, where each level in the hierarchy refines and narrows the scope of the previous level. Below is an outline of the structure: Level 0: Broad Categories The top level defines the broadest categories, such as National Sectors , which represent the major domains within which actors operate. This level is designed to give an overarching view of general sectors relevant to geopolitical events. Level 1: Primary Sectors Each broad category is divided into primary sectors, such as Government within the \"National Sectors\" category. Primary sectors help narrow down the focus to specific functions or domains within each broad category. Level 2: Sub-Sectors Primary sectors are further broken down into sub-sectors. For example, within \"Government,\" the sub-sector Executive defines a specific segment of government operations. Sub-sectors allow analysts to distinguish between different functions within the primary sector. Level 3: Specific Offices or Functions Each sub-sector may contain specific offices or functions. For instance, the Executive Office represents a concrete function within the Executive sub-sector, focusing on entities like the Presidential Office or Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Level 4: Detailed Ministries or Units At the deepest level, the tree includes particular ministries or specialized units within the office functions, such as the Agriculture / Fishing / Forestry Ministry . This level provides the most specific categorization, allowing for granular analysis of events related to individual government ministries or departments. Purpose and Application of the ICEWS Ontology The ICEWS sectors ontology aids in the systematic classification of actors in global events, allowing analysts to: - Improve Analysis Consistency : By using a standardized structure, analysts can consistently categorize entities across different regions and contexts. - Enable Targeted Filtering : The hierarchy allows users to filter events and actors by specific levels, making it easier to focus on relevant sectors. - Support Crisis Detection : By categorizing entities into detailed roles and functions, the system enhances the detection of sector-specific crises and patterns. This hierarchical structure supports ICEWS\u2019s mission of predicting, analyzing, and responding to international crises by categorizing entities with a high degree of specificity. Example of ICEWS Sector Hierarchy Here\u2019s an example of how a sector might be organized: National Sectors Government Executive Executive Office Agriculture / Fishing / Forestry Ministry This structure provides analysts with a clear, organized framework for categorizing the roles and functions of entities in global events, supporting comprehensive and targeted crisis analysis.","title":"Who"},{"location":"who/#who-subject-and-object-filters","text":"The Who section in the Trender system allows users to filter news articles based on the people or entities involved.
